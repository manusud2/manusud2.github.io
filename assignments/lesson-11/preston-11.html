                  Preston, Idaho is one of the best kept secrets of the West.
                  Nestled on the Idaho side of beautiful Cache Valley and surrounded 
                  by towering mountains on each side, it is unbeatable for recreation 
                  opportunities, has that small town feeling, and is close to whatever 
                  you need.  
        
                  It is one of the safest places to live in the State of Idaho and in 
                  Cache Valley.

                  For several years the city held a "Napoleon Dynamite Festival" in the summer.
                  Many of the featured festival themes related to events occurring during the film. 
                  For example: Tetherball Tournament, Tater Tot Eating Contest, Moon Boot Dance, 
                  Impersonation, Look-A-Like Contest, Football Throwing Contest and more. 
                  In 2004 there was a single day event that drew approximately 300 people. 
                  Although this was not a large crowd, it did help raise $1,500 for the Preston 
                  School District Education Foundation. In 2005 an estimated 6,000 people attended 
                  the event, but that number dropped to an estimated 400 people in 2006. The 2007 and
                   2008 event was held along with the 'That Famous Preston Night Rodeo' in Preston. 
                   There are no plans for reviving the event. 'That Famous Preston Night Rodeo' is 
                   usually held in late July, along with the Franklin County parade. The rodeo's name 
                   ('That Famous Preston Night Rodeo') comes from it being the first rodeo held during 
                   night time. It includes many events such as bull riding, barrel racing, and other 
                   popular events. The Franklin county parade includes floats and advertisements of 
                   local businesses. The rodeo and parade remain one of the town's most popular local 
                   events and traditions.
